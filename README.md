# Data Structures in Python

This repository includes Python implementations of various **data structures** including **Stack**, **Queue**, **Linked Lists**, and **N-dimensional Arrays**. These implementations cover both **array-based** and **dynamic linked list-based** approaches, along with additional features such as an **expression parser**.

## Programs Included:

- **Stack**: Implemented using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queue**: Implemented using arrays and dynamic linked lists.
- **Linked Lists**: Operations such as **append**, **insert**, **delete**, and **search**.
- **N-Dimensional Arrays**: Creation and manipulation of N-dimensional arrays using **NumPy**.
- **Expression Parser**: A basic parser for evaluating mathematical expressions using **stacks**.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
